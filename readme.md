If you eliminate a blue letter, all letters currently shown in the screen will be much slower(almost stops) please use it wisely!<br>

> Possibility: 10%

### Explode(Red)

If you eliminate a red letter, all letters currently shown in the screen will be eliminated. The tip here is to try not to die before a red letter shows up.Good Luck!<br>
